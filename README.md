# alignment_algorithms

The code in final.py script is an implementation of two algorithms:
i) Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for computing OPTIMAL GLOBAL ALIGNMENT, and
ii) Smith-Waterman algorithm for computing OPTIMAL LOCAL ALIGNMENT,

both use affine gap penalty function between two input DNA sequences, s1 and s2, of lengths m and n respectively. 

COMMAND PROMPT :  

$ <executable name> <input file containing both s1 and s2> <0: global, 1: local> <path to parameters config file>
